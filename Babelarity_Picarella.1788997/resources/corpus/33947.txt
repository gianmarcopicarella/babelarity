Abies sachalinensis (Sakhalin fir) is a species of conifer in the family Pinaceae. It is found in Sakhalin island and southern Kurils (Russia), and also in northern Hokkaido (Japan).
The first "discovery" by a European was by Carl Friedrich Schmidt, aka F. Schmidt, aka Fedor Bogdanovich (1832-1908), the Baltic German botanist, on the Russian island of Sakhalin in 1866, but he did not introduce it to Europe. The plant was re-discovered by the English plant-collector, Charles Maries in 1877 near Aomori on the main Japanese island of Honshū, who initially thought it to be a variety of Abies veitchii.
