Maumere is the seat capital of the Sikka Regency and the largest town in Flores, Indonesia. It lies on the north coast of the island and the port is in the north-west part of the town. Frans Seda Airport is located in Maumere. In 1992 Maumere had a total population of 70,000.
The town suffered considerable damage in the 1992 Indonesia earthquake, with 90 per cent of all buildings being destroyed. The more recent Census population is 47,598.
In 2005, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Maumere was established in the town.
The reefs in areas surrounding Maumere (the Maumere Gulf) were once considered some of the finest diving in the world. However, a 2007 report found that 75% of the coral reefs had been significantly damaged or destroyed by the practice of bomb fishing, the use of toxic chemicals in fishing, and due to earthquakes. One priority of the local community and government is the promotion of tourism. An annual cultural event, Maumere in Love, has been initiated as a step towards fostering both local and wider interest in the region around Maumere.
Mother of All Nations (Indonesian: Bunda Segala Bangsa) is a statue of Mother Mary in Nilo hill, 5 km south-west from Maumere. The statue stands 18 metres (59 ft) tall, but with its pedestal and foundation it is 28 metres (92 ft) tall. The 6-ton copper-clad statue was constructed on 2005, located at the peak of the 500 metre (1,640 ft) Keli hill, Nilo village, and has become the tallest statue raised in Sikka Regency.
