In mathematics, the Laguerre polynomials, named after Edmond Laguerre (1834 - 1886), are solutions of Laguerre's equation:
        x
          y
          ″
        +
        (
        1
        −
        x
        )
          y
          ′
        +
        n
        y
        =
        0
    {\displaystyle xy''+(1-x)y'+ny=0}
which is a second-order linear differential equation. This equation has nonsingular solutions only if n is a non-negative integer.
More generally, the name Laguerre polynomials is used for solutions of
        x
          y
          ″
        +
        (
        α
        +
        1
        −
        x
        )
          y
          ′
        +
        n
        y
        =
        0
        .
    {\displaystyle xy''+(\alpha +1-x)y'+ny=0~.}
Then they are also named generalized Laguerre polynomials, as will be done here (alternatively associated Laguerre polynomials or, rarely, Sonin polynomials, after their inventor Nikolay Yakovlevich Sonin).
The Laguerre polynomials are also used for Gaussian quadrature to numerically compute integrals of the form
          ∫
            0
            ∞
        f
        (
        x
        )
          e
            −
            x
        d
        x
        .
    {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }f(x)e^{-x}\,dx.}
These polynomials, usually denoted L0, L1, ..., are a polynomial sequence which may be defined by the Rodrigues formula,
          L
            n
        (
        x
        )
        =
              e
                x
              n
              !
              d
                n
              d
                x
                  n
          (
            e
              −
              x
            x
              n
          )
        =
            1
              n
              !
            (
                d
                  d
                  x
            −
            1
            )

            n
        ,
    {\displaystyle L_{n}(x)={\frac {e^{x}}{n!}}{\frac {d^{n}}{dx^{n}}}\left(e^{-x}x^{n}\right)={\frac {1}{n!}}\left({\frac {d}{dx}}-1\right)^{n}x^{n},}
reducing to the closed form of a following section.
They are orthogonal polynomials with respect to an inner product
        ⟨
        f
        ,
        g
        ⟩
        =

    {\displaystyle \langle f,g\rangle =\int _{0}^{\infty }f(x)g(x)e^{-x}\,dx.}
The sequence of Laguerre polynomials n! Ln is a Sheffer sequence,

              d

          L

          )
          L
            n
            −
            1
        .
    {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}L_{n}=\left({\frac {d}{dx}}-1\right)L_{n-1}.}
The Rook polynomials in combinatorics are more or less the same as Laguerre polynomials, up to elementary changes of variables. Further see the Tricomi–Carlitz polynomials.
The Laguerre polynomials arise in quantum mechanics, in the radial part of the solution of the Schrödinger equation for a one-electron atom. They also describe the static Wigner functions of oscillator systems in quantum mechanics in phase space. They further enter in the quantum mechanics of the Morse potential and of the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.
Physicists sometimes use a definition for the Laguerre polynomials which is larger by a factor of n! than the definition used here. (Likewise, some physicists may use somewhat different definitions of the so-called associated Laguerre polynomials.)
These are the first few Laguerre polynomials:
One can also define the Laguerre polynomials recursively, defining the first two polynomials as
          L
            0
        (
        x
        )
        =

    {\displaystyle L_{0}(x)=1}

            1
        (
        x
        )
        =
        1
        −
        x
    {\displaystyle L_{1}(x)=1-x}
and then using the following recurrence relation for any k ≥ 1:
          L
            k
            +
            1
        (
        x
        )
        =
              (
              2
              k
              +

              −
              x
              )
                L
                  k
              (

              −
              k
                L
                  k
                  −
                  1
              (
              x

        .
    {\displaystyle L_{k+1}(x)={\frac {(2k+1-x)L_{k}(x)-kL_{k-1}(x)}{k+1}}.}
The closed form is

            n
        (
        x
        )
        =
          ∑
            k
            =

    {\displaystyle L_{n}(x)=\sum _{k=0}^{n}{\binom {n}{k}}{\frac {(-1)^{k}}{k!}}x^{k}.}
The generating function for them likewise follows,
          ∑
            n
            ∞
          t
            n

        )
        =

              1
              −
              t
          e
            −
                  t
                  x
                  1

                  t
        .
    {\displaystyle \sum _{n}^{\infty }t^{n}L_{n}(x)={\frac {1}{1-t}}e^{-{\frac {tx}{1-t}}}.}
Polynomials of negative index can be expressed using the ones with positive index:
          L
            −
            n
        (
        x
        )

            1
        (
        −
        x
        )
        .
    {\displaystyle L_{-n}(x)=e^{x}L_{n-1}(-x).}
For arbitrary real α the polynomial solutions of the differential equation 
        x
          y
          ″
        +
        (
        α
        +
        1
        −

        y
        =
        0
    {\displaystyle x\,y''+(\alpha +1-x)\,y'+n\,y=0}
are called generalized Laguerre polynomials, or associated Laguerre polynomials.
One can also define the generalized Laguerre polynomials recursively, defining the first two polynomials as
          L
            0
            (
            α

The simple Laguerre polynomials are the special case α = 0 of the generalized Laguerre polynomials:

        x
        )

This points to a special case (α = 0) of the formula above: for integer α = k the generalized polynomial may be written
          L
            n

            k
            )

        )
        =
        (
        −
        1
          )
            k

        ,
    {\displaystyle L_{n}^{(k)}(x)=(-1)^{k}{\frac {d^{k}L_{n+k}(x)}{dx^{k}}},}
the shift by k sometimes causing confusion with the usual parenthesis notation for a derivative.
Moreover, the following equation holds:

which generalizes with Cauchy's formula to

The derivative with respect to the second variable α has the form,

    {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{d\alpha }}L_{n}^{(\alpha )}(x)=\sum _{i=0}^{n-1}{\frac {L_{i}^{(\alpha )}(x)}{n-i}}.}
This is evident from the contour integral representation below.
