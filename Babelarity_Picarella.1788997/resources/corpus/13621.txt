The Women's road time trial at the 2008 Summer Olympics took place on August 13 at the Urban Road Cycling Course. Of the 25 women competing in the event, the medal hopefuls included Karin Thürig (Switzerland), Judith Arndt and Hanka Kupfernagel (Germany), Marianne Vos (Netherlands), Christiane Soeder (Austria), and road race gold medalist Nicole Cooke (Great Britain).
Cyclists started at two-minute intervals on the course, which was 23.5 km (14.6 mi) in length. They competed against the clock rather than in a direct race against the cyclists.
Kristin Armstrong of the USA won the event in under 35 minutes, finishing 24.29 seconds ahead of Emma Pooley of Great Britain. Armstrong's average speed was 40.445 km/h (25.1 mph). [1]
