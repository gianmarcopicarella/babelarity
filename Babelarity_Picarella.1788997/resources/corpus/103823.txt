Suwannee County is a county located in the state of Florida. As of the 2010 census, the population was 41,551. Its county seat is Live Oak. Suwannee County was a dry county until August 2011, when the sale of alcoholic beverages became legal in the county.
Suwannee County was created in 1858, as railways were constructed through the area connecting it to Jacksonville, Tallahassee, and points north. It was named after the Suwannee River, which forms the county's northern, western, and much of its southern border. The word "Suwannee" may either be a corruption of the Spanish San Juan ("Saint John") or from the Cherokee sawani ("echo river").
The rural areas supported numerous lumber and turpentine camps. In the 1930s, the anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston did research in North Florida timber camps.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 692 square miles (1,790 km2), of which 689 square miles (1,780 km2) is land and 3.7 square miles (9.6 km2) (0.5%) is water.

Suwannee County has one surviving railroad line. The primary one is a CSX line formerly owned by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad that served Amtrak's Sunset Limited until it was truncated to New Orleans in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina. Union Depot and Atlantic Coast Line Freight Station was Suwannee County's premiere railroad station on the corner of US 129 & SR 136 in Live Oak, and served both the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and Seaboard Air Line Railroad but has not been in use since the mid-20th Century. Various abandoned lines also exist within the county, one of which was converted into the Suwannee River Greenway Trail, along the southeastern part of the county.
