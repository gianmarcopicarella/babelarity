A men's football tournament is held at every Pan American Games since the first edition of the multi-sports event in 1951, a women's tournament was introduced in 1999.
The tournament was played in league format from 1951 to 1963, neither final nor bronze medal match hosted. Another format was used in 1971, this time the tournament was played in group format in early stages, but played in league format for final stages. The 1983 tournament saw only 3 teams played in the final group stages, with the first and final time the tournament did not have the fourth place team.

Teams participate with their U-22 squads. In some cases such as in 1951 (for Venezuela and Costa Rica) some countries sent their full squad (including players over the age of 22).
