Stephano (/ˈstɛfənoʊ/ STEF-ə-noh or /stᵻˈfɑːnoʊ/ stə-FAH-noh) is a retrograde irregular satellite of Uranus. It was discovered by Brett J. Gladman, et al. in 1999, and given the provisional designation S/1999 U 2.
Confirmed as Uranus XX, it was named after the drunken butler in William Shakespeare's play The Tempest in August 2000.
The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong to the same dynamic cluster as Caliban, suggesting common origin.
