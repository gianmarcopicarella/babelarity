Hanyū (羽生市, Hanyū-shi) is a city located in Saitama Prefecture, in the central Kantō region of Japan. As of 1 February 2016, the city had an estimated population of 54,916 and a population density of 936 persons per km². Its total area was 58.64 square kilometres (22.64 sq mi).
Hanyū is located in the most northern part of Saitama Prefecture. Hanyū's northern border is the Tone River. Before the river was redirected to its current course to control flooding, it used to flow though the city. This river was used as a major shipping route for locally produced textiles and goods from further up river. Hanyū flourished as a stopping point on the long ride toward Tokyo. Today only an irrigation channel remains in the approximate location of the original river path.
