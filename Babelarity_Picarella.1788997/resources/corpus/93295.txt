The suborder Myomorpha contains 1,137 species of mouse-like rodents, nearly a quarter of all mammal species. Included are mice, rats, gerbils, hamsters, lemmings and voles. They are grouped according to the structure of their jaws and molar teeth. Both their medial and lateral masseter muscles are displaced forward, making them adept at gnawing. The medial masseter muscle goes through the eye socket, a feature unique among mammals. Myomorphs are found worldwide (apart from Antarctica) in almost all land habitats. They are usually nocturnal seed-eaters.
Most myomorph species belong to the superfamily Muroidea: (hamsters, voles, lemmings, true mice, true rats and gerbils).
Superfamily Muroidea
Family Platacanthomyidae (spiny dormice and Chinese pygmy dormice)
Family Spalacidae (blind mole-rats and bamboo rats)
Family Calomyscidae (mouse-like hamsters)

Family Cricetidae (true hamsters, voles and lemmings)

Historically, the definition of the suborder Myomorpha has included one or both of:
Superfamily Geomyoidea (gophers and kangaroo rats)
Family Heteromyidae (kangaroo rats)
Family Geomyidae (gophers)
Superfamily Gliroidea (true dormice)
Family Gliridae
