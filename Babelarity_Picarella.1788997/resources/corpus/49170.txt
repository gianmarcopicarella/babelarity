Nordic gold is the gold-coloured copper alloy from which the middle three denominations of euro coins, 50 cent, 20 cent, and 10 cent coins are made. It has also been in use for a number of years in other countries, most notably in the Swedish 10-krona coin for which it was originally developed (hence the Swedish name: nordiskt guld). Its composition is 89% copper, 5% aluminium, 5% zinc, and 1% tin.
Despite its name, it contains no gold and its colour and weight are quite unlike pure gold. It is non-allergenic; its other advantages include antimycotic and weak antimicrobial (especially after abrasion) attributes, and resistance to tarnishing. The alloy and its tradename are the intellectual property of the global metals and manufacturing group, Luvata (formerly Outokumpu Copper Products).
