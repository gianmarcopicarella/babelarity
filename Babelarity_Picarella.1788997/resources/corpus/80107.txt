In April 2007, in recognition of his efforts to promote Canadian writing talent, and to recognize his efforts as the primary creative writing force on the Stargate shows, Wright was presented with the inaugural "Showrunner Award" at the Canadian Screenwriting Awards in Toronto. In July of the same year, he won the 2007 Constellation Award in the category Best Overall 2006 Science Fiction Film or Television Script for the episode of Stargate SG-1 entitled "200".
