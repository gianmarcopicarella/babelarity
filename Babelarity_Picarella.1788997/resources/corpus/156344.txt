"An Eternal Flame burns brightly and was donated to the City of Eastlake by the East Ohio Gas Company, commemorating the arrival of the Olympic Torch. A ceremony was held in Eastlake on June 10, 1996 as the Olympic Torch made its way through the United States from Greece to Atlanta for the 1996 Olympics. The Torch Ceremony attracted nearly 5,000 people to the area for that very special celebration." 
On August 14, 2003, the single largest blackout in North American history occurred. The blackout caused 50 million people to lose power in eight US states and southeastern Canada. Although it took months to diagnose the actual cause of the blackout, it was eventually traced back to a FirstEnergy powerplant in Eastlake, where a high-voltage power line brushed up against an overgrowth of trees causing the line to shut down, which, due to a failed alert system, caused a domino effect of power lines switching off. All in all, 11 people died and around $6 billion in damages were reported, prompting the creation of a joint energy task force between the US and Canada to minimize future blackouts.
For decades, Eastlake, Ohio has been a hotbed of UFO activity, specifically centered around Lake Erie. Most notable was an incident on March 4, 1988 which prompted numerous residents to call the authorities and even resulted in an official US Cost Guard report about the incident.
More recently, an influx of UFO activity has been reported over Lake Erie since the mid-2000s to present. These reports center around strange and unexplainable light phenomena, and have been discussed and covered in the media by local news and national outlets such as the History Channel.
Eastlake is home to a minor league baseball stadium which hosts the Cleveland Indians' Class A Affiliate, the Lake County Captains. This stadium did not come to the city without controversy, however. After skewing facts and manipulating voters to push through new tax levies to fund the project, Eastlake's then mayor Dan Diliberto realized he was in trouble once the details of the project became public and the city was pushed to the brink of financial insolvency. Then, in a move that could have been ripped straight from a big-screen thriller, Diliberto vacated his office and fled to Florida, later being forced to return to Ohio where he was eventually charged with fraud and order to pay fines as well as serve jail time.
