Avon Lake is a city in Lorain County, Ohio, United States, located on Lake Erie. The population was 22,581 at the 2010 census.
Avon Lake was designated a Tree City USA by the National Arbor Day Foundation.
Avon Lake was first settled in the 17th century and was, along with Avon, Bay Village, and Westlake, inhabited by Wyandots, Eries, Ottawas, etc. These people settled, traded, fought, made peace, and later moved elsewhere. Avon Lake, Avon, Bay Village, and Westlake were all one territory, Xeuma.
This place has been so far a part of three nations. Sometime prior to 1765, this territory was part of France. In 1765, the French were driven out by the English. Eighteen years later, in 1783, the English were forced out by the newly-independent United States. During the Revolutionary War, a direct trail from the east to the west crossed the lake shore through what now includes Avon Lake. This trail is where Lake Road is today. It was used by the British more than by the colonists.
After a series of treaties, the area was purchased by the Connecticut Land Company in 1795 as the Western Reserve. Pierpont Eas formed, and the following settlers called the territory of present-day Avon Lake, Avon, Bay Village, and Westlake by a Native American term which means "those who came before us", "Xeuma". French and English colonial forces did the same things here as the Natives.
Noah Davis, the first lakeshore dweller, arrived in 1812 and lived in a three-sided cabin near the present-day intersection of Lake and Moore Roads for about a year. Wilbur Cahoon, owner of the land, encounted Davis and moved farther south (on Davis' advice) in the French Creek precinct where it was not as marshy but more fitting for farming, in 1814.
In 1818, Cuyahoga County drew new boundaries, splitting Xeuma into two. The west part was Troy Township and the east part was Dover Township. Adam Miller and his family arrived in the following year, and the family has been here ever since. The Millers and others who followed mostly cleared land, sawed timber, and built ships in nearby Black River (eventually renamed Lorain), however Avon Lake's shorelines also had a number of sawmills and shipyards.
In 1822, Lorain County was formed. Troy Township was renamed "Avon Township" by petition in 1824.
European seamen first settled this place in the year 1812, and was originally part of the Avon Township, and also part of Cuyahoga County. Then in 1822, it became part of Lorain County. Then, in 1915, this part of Avon was separated from the rest of the Township of Avon to form the Township of Avon Lake. In 1960, Avon Lake was granted the status of a city.
