Winnebago were the only inhabitants in the area of Maple Grove until 1851 when Louis Gervais arrived and settled. Four years later, in 1855, city growth included a church, town hall and many homes. The city was known for its large stands of maple trees and was, therefore, a significant source for maple syrup.
With the completion and major upgrades to Interstates 94 / 694, 494, and U.S. Highway 169, Maple Grove has grown at a rapid pace since the 1970s. Maple Grove has grown into one of the most populous cities in the Twin Cities area, and identified as one of the fastest growing cities in the state. Maple Grove was also named the second best place to live in 2014 by Money magazine.

The city is home to a 2,000-acre (8.1 km2) gravel mining area owned by Tiller Corporation and C.S. McCrossan. Active since the 1920s, the GMA is slowly being developed into a residential and commercial downtown. The first phase included Main Street, a collection of one- and two-story buildings with storefronts built in new urbanist (or neotraditional) style. The second phase was generally considered to be the Shoppes of Arbor Lakes and the third phase was the Fountains at Arbor Lakes.
Minnesota's first so-called 'lifestyle center', The Shoppes at Arbor Lakes, is designed in the spirit of a mid-century American village and includes stores such as Pottery Barn, Brooks Brothers, Williams-Sonoma, GoodThings, National Camera Exchange, Hot Mama, Teavana, Anthropologie, P.F. Chang's, World Market, and numerous other upscale stores. This lifestyle center was built in 2003 and has been replicated in Woodbury, Minnesota (Woodbury Lakes). Maple Grove's Shoppes at Arbor Lakes is 412,000 square feet (38,300 m2) in size and is home to more than 65 stores and restaurants.
The most recent Arbor Lakes development is a hybrid power center development called The Fountains at Arbor Lakes. At 850,000 square feet (79,000 m2), this retail complex includes stores such as Costco, Caribou Coffee, Subway, DSW, Lowe's, REI and a Holiday Inn & Suites with a water park. The Fountains also includes Minnesota's most energy efficient building, Great River Energy Headquarters.
Maple Grove's most recent development, The Grove, is located at the intersection of Interstate 94 and Maple Grove Parkway. This district is home to the new North Memorial/Fairview hospital complex, SuperTarget, Home Depot, Slumberland and other stores. The central portion of the project is designed to be pedestrian-friendly and encourage a small-town atmosphere within the larger scale of the development.
Maple Grove is home to more retail than nearly any other city in the state, second only to Bloomington, the home of the Mall of America. Maple Grove itself is likely to have nearly 6 million square feet (600,000 m²) of commercial development at build out, which may soon push the city into the number one spot for retail square-footage. One prominent retail complex is the Grove Square shopping mall, which has a JCPenney anchor store. Opus Northwest, the developer of the property, selected the location of the initial property development because "it’s the first major city in upstate Minnesota" and serves as "a major hub for that submarket" drawing consumers from the entire upstate region.
