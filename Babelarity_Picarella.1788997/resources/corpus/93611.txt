The Pernambuco pygmy owl (Glaucidium mooreorum) is a species of owl in the family Strigidae. This recently described species is endemic to Pernambuco in Brazil. It has been argued that it actually should be referred to as G. minutissimum (a name typically used for the East Brazilian pygmy owl), but this has not gained widespread recognition.
This owl is classified as critically endangered by BirdLife International. It is assumed to have a tiny and declining population within an extremely small known range. The population is estimated at less than fifty adult birds. The Pernambuco pygmy owl was first described in December 2002 when two study skins were examined in Pernambuco, Brazil. The skins were originally collected in 1980 and thought to be subspecies of the least pygmy owl (Glaucidium minutissimum) or Amazonian pygmy owl (Glaucidium hardyi). Upon closer examination of the skins, and vocalisations of the birds also obtained in 1980, it was concluded that this was a new species.
