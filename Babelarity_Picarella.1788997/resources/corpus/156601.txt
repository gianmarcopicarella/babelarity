Otsego County is a county located in the U.S. state of New York. At the 2010 census, the population was 62,259. The county seat is Cooperstown. The name Otsego is from a Mohawk or Oneida word meaning "place of the rock".
Otsego County comprises the Oneonta, NY Micropolitan Statistical Area.
In 1789, Ontario County was split off from Montgomery. The area split off from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, as it included the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler and Wayne counties.
Otsego County was one of three counties split off from Montgomery (the other two being Herkimer and Tioga). Otsego County was officially established on February 16, 1791, with Cooperstown as its county seat, although at the time the village of Cherry Valley was much larger. The original county consisted of three large townships:
Cherry Valley in the northeast,
Otsego in the northwest, and
Harpersfield in the south.
Otsego and Cherry Valley together roughly covered the area of modern Otsego County, while Harpersfield covered the area south of the current county as far as the Delaware River.
The original appointments to Otsego County government positions, made by Governor George Clinton included:
Richard R. Smith, county sheriff, from Otsego township,
Jacob Morris, county clerk, from Otsego township,
William Cooper, chief judge, from Otsego township,
Jedediah Peck, associate justice from Otsego township,
Edward Griswold, associate justice from Cherry Valley
Platt Townsend, associate justice from Harpersfield,
Alexander Harper, commander of the county militia, from Harpersfield.
By 1793, four towns had been added to the county by division of the existing towns:
The Otsego township had been divided into the towns of:
Burlington in the west,
Otsego in the northeast,
Richfield in the north, and
Unadilla in the south.
Harpersfield had been divided into the towns of:
Franklin in the west and
Harpersfield in the east.
In 1795, a piece of Otsego County was joined with a portion taken from Albany County to create Schoharie County.
In 1797, a piece of Otsego County was joined with a portion taken from Ulster County to create Delaware County.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,016 square miles (2,630 km2), of which 1,002 square miles (2,600 km2) is land and 14 square miles (36 km2) (1.4%) is water.
Otsego County is in central New York State, to the west of Albany, southeast of Utica, and northeast of Binghamton. The county is part of the Mohawk Valley region of New York State. The county is considered by some to belong to the Southern Tier region of New York State.

The Village of Cooperstown (home of James Fenimore Cooper), located at the south end of Otsego Lake, attracts many tourists to the Baseball Hall of Fame and the New York State Historical Association museums. Its primary industry is healthcare as it is home to Bassett Medical Center, the headquarters of Bassett Healthcare Network and its more than 3,000 employees. The City of Oneonta is the home of Hartwick College, the State University of New York at Oneonta, A.O. Fox Memorial Hospital an affiliate of the Bassett Network, major retail activity, and numerous small businesses. The county as a whole remains relatively rural, with dairy farming a contributing industry that has consolidated employment in recent years, although production has remained steady.
