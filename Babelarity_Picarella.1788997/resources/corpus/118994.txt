Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hans Walter (born February 9, 1954) is a German physicist/engineer and a former DFVLR astronaut.
Walter was born in Iserlohn. After finishing secondary school there and two years in the Bundeswehr, he studied physics at the University of Cologne. In 1980, he was awarded a diploma degree, and five years later a doctorate, both in the field of solid-state physics.
After two post-doc positions at the Argonne National Laboratory, Chicago, Illinois, and the University of California at Berkeley, California, he was selected in 1987 to join the German astronaut team. From 1988 to 1990, he completed basic training at the German German Aerospace Center, and was then nominated to be in the prime crew for the second German Spacelab mission.

Since 2003, he has been a full professor at the Technische Universität München (Munich, Germany), holding the chair of the Institute of Astronautics (space technology) at the University's faculty of mechanical engineering.
He is author of several books, and also does work as presenter of a popular science magazine shows, such as MaxQ on Bavarian TV.
He received honorary doctorate from the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, Ukraine (2012).
