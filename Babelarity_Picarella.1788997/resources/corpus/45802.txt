Panzerfaust is the fifth studio album by Norwegian black metal band Darkthrone, released in June 1995 by Moonfog Productions (Europe) and The End Records (North America).
Much of the album was similar in style to early Celtic Frost, particularly the songs "Triumphant Gleam", "The Hordes of Nebulah" and "Beholding the Throne of Might". However, the production continued in a similar "raw" vein to that of Transilvanian Hunger (1994). The vocals were mixed loudly so that the instruments seemed to get quieter during vocal parts, as if they were side-chained. "Quintessence" featured lyrics by Varg Vikernes, their second and final album to do so.
In October 2010, Panzerfaust was reissued by Peaceville as a two-disc edition, with the second disc featuring Fenriz discussing the making of the album and the subject matter of the songs. In this commentary, Fenriz cited Celtic Frost's Morbid Tales (1984), Bathory's Under the Sign of the Black Mark (1987) and Vader's Necrolust (1989) as key riff inspirations.
All lyrics written by Fenriz, except where noted, all music composed by Darkthrone.
