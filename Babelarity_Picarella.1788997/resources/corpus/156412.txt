Guardamar del Segura (Valencian pronunciation: [ˌɡwaɾðaˈmaɾ ðeɫ seˈɣuɾa]) or briefly Guardamar is a municipality of the province of Alicante located at the mouth of the river Segura in southern Valencia (autonomous community), Spain. It is a Mediterranean resort, with a large pine forest abutting an 11-km-long white sand beach.
Historically an area of fishermen and farmers, Guardamar del Segura is the southernmost point where Valenciano (a dialect of Catalan) is spoken. A Phoenician colony, called Herna by Roman geographer Avienus in his book Ora Maritima was the first settlement near the mouth of Segura river, In Spanish, "guardar" means "safekeeping" and "mar" means "sea", and this is another possible basis for its current name.
