Iwade (岩出市, Iwade-shi) is a city in Wakayama Prefecture, Japan.
At the end of January 31, 2011, the city has an estimated population of 53,280, with 20,945 households and a population density of 1,400 persons per km². The total area is 38.5 km².
Negoroji temple was founded in the 12th century. (see also Negoro-gumi, Siege of Negoroji.) The Kinokawa River flows along the south of Iwade. Iwade was formerly located within the former Naga District until April 1, 2006, when Iwade gained city status which dissolved the district.
August 1, 1908 - The village of Iwade was elevated to town status: the start of the town of Iwade (1st generation).
September 30, 1956 - During the big mergers of the Showa era, the town merged with the villages of Kamiiwade, Nera, Yamazaki, and parts of Kokura (the localities of Funado and Yamazaki). The town of Iwade was formed, with the same area of the current city. The town had the population of 13,000. The remaining parts of Kokura were merged into the city of Wakayama.
April 1, 2006 - Iwade was elevated to city status to become the ninth city in the prefecture. The prior town to become a city was Arida from Arida District on May 1, 1956.
Iwade was one of the 6 towns in Naga District, but on November 7, 2005, 5 towns merged to form the new city of Kinokawa.
After the town grew to more than 50,000 people as of the 2005 census and at the request of residents, Iwade decided to gain city status alone. Iwade fulfilled the requirements to gain city status by both the ordinance of Wakayama Prefecture and Local Government Law.
The cities able to gain city status alone in Japan were Tomisato in Chiba Prefecture (formerly part of Inba District) and Tomigusuku in Okinawa Prefecture (formerly part of Shimajiri District) on April 1, 2002. The only town to gain city status alone is Arida as written above, but in the Kinki Region, it has been 4 and a half years since the town Ritto in Shiga Prefecture gained city status alone on October 1, 2001.
On March 3, 2006, the Wakayama Prefectural Government allowed Iwade to gain city status. It was officially announced to the government on March 17.
