Trotwood was originally called Higgins Station, and under the latter name was platted in 1854.
The Village of Trotwood was incorporated in 1901 from portions of Madison Township (the township itself was established in 1809); in 1996 the village and township merged into a single political entity. This merger resulted in the creation of a Trotwood neighborhood (Townview) that is completely surrounded by the City of Dayton. Several smaller sections are attached to Trotwood by only a roadway or a small strip of land. The merger also added a large rural area to this suburban community consisting of farms, golf courses, and large rural estates.
