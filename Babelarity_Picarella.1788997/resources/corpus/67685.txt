Moore is a city in Cleveland County, Oklahoma, United States, and is part of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. The population was 55,081 at the 2010 census, making Moore the 7th largest city in the state of Oklahoma.
Located between Oklahoma City and Norman, the city has been the site of several devastating tornadoes, with those occurring in 1999 and 2013 receiving national attention.
The Moore post office was established May 27, 1889, during the Land Run of 1889 and was named for Al Moore, an Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway employee. According to the town history he was a "conductor or a brakeman, lived in a boxcar at the camp and had difficulty receiving his mail. He painted his name – "Moore" – on a board and nailed it on the boxcar. When a postmaster was appointed, he continued to call the settlement Moore. When the town incorporated in 1893 the name was legalized."
The city's history notes that the community before the post office may have been called "Verbeck" by the railroad. However, other histories indicate that Verbeck was actually the original name of the nearby telegraph station "Oklahoma" which became the basis for the founding of Oklahoma City.
The community remained small until 1961, when it annexed 21.6 square miles (56 km2), becoming a full-fledged city in 1962, which in turn increased its population from 1,221 in 1960 to 18,761 in 1970 and 55,081 in 2010. Moore's 1961 annexation kept it an independent city at a time when Oklahoma City through annexations increased its size from 25 square miles (65 km2) to 643 square miles (1,670 km2) surrounding Moore on three sides (north, east, west). Norman forms its southern border.
In 1966 the Hillsdale Free Will Baptist College, after moving through various locations around Oklahoma, opened in the community.
The Moore post office turned into a branch of the Oklahoma City post office on January 7, 1972.
In the 1970s the city launched a "Smile America" campaign in which giant red, white and blue smileys were painted on the town water towers. A smiley also adorns the city's official logo (as does a water tower). Some of the water towers now have a sign that says, "Moore - Home of Toby Keith."
On September 24, 2014, at the local Vaughan Foods food processing plant, one employee was beheaded with a knife and another coworker had her throat slit and was injured, but survived. The alleged attacker, 30-year-old Alton Nolen, who was on suspension from the plant prior to the attack due to interactions with the employee who survived the attack, was shot and wounded by company owner Mark Vaughan. Nolen, who is alleged to have converted to Islam and was an extremist, will face charges of first-degree murder and assault and battery with a deadly weapon, and may also face federal charges as well. The attack followed a series of beheadings committed by the Islamic terrorist group ISIS.
Moore has seen ten tornadoes between 1998 and 2015, three of them big enough to claim lives and cause catastrophic damage. The city of Moore was damaged by significant tornadoes on October 4, 1998; May 3, 1999; May 8, 2003; May 10, 2010; and May 20, 2013, with weaker tornadoes striking at other times, notably May 31, 2013 and March 25, 2015. Moore is located in Tornado Alley, a colloquial term for the area of the United States where tornadoes are most frequent. About 20 tornadoes occurred in the immediate vicinity of Moore from 1890 to 2013. The most significant tornadoes to hit Moore occurred in 1999 and 2013.
The May 3, 1999, tornado that hit Moore and nearby areas, which was rated an F5 on the Fujita scale, was the most costly tornado in history at the time (not adjusted for changes in inflation and population). The tornado, which occurred during the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak, had an approximate recorded wind speed of 301 mph (484 km/h) as sampled by mobile Doppler radar, the highest wind speed ever recorded on Earth. It left a swath of destruction over 1 mile (1.6 km) wide at times, and 38 miles (60 km) long. It killed a total of 36 people in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. This was the deadliest F5 tornado recorded since the Delhi, Louisiana tornado in 1971 until this mark was eclipsed by several tornadoes in 2011.
On May 20, 2013, parts of Moore and neighboring Newcastle and southern Oklahoma City, were affected by a violent tornado. Classified as EF5, it had estimated wind speeds of 200–210 mph (320–340 km/h), a maximum width of 1.3 miles (2 km), and a path length of 17 miles (30 km). Entire subdivisions were destroyed; the tornado struck Briarwood and Plaza Towers elementary schools in Moore, while school was in session. The Oklahoma Medical Examiner's office reported that 24 people were killed, including 10 children. Over 140 patients, including at least 70 children, were treated at hospitals following the tornado. It was the deadliest U.S. tornado since the Joplin, Missouri tornado that killed 158 people in 2011.
Moore is located just south of Oklahoma City and north of Norman, in central Oklahoma. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 22.2 square miles (57.4 km2), of which 21.8 square miles (56.5 km2) is land and 0.35 square miles (0.9 km2), or 1.52%, is water.
The city lies in the Sandstone Hills region of Oklahoma, known for hills, blackjack oak, and post oak.
Moore has a humid subtropical climate with frequent variations in weather during part of the year and consistently hot summers. Prolonged and severe droughts often lead to wildfires and heavy rainfall often leads to flash flooding and flooding. Consistent winds, usually from the south or south-southeast during the summer, help temper the hotter weather. Consistent northerly winds during the winter can intensify cold periods. Severe ice storms and snowstorms happen sporadically during the winter.
The city is located in Tornado Alley and is subject to frequent and severe tornadoes and hailstorms. The Oklahoma City metropolitan area is one of the most tornado-prone major cities in the world.

The City of Moore has funded the construction of a memorial to honor America's veterans and their families. The city renamed JD Estates Park to Veterans Memorial Park, and a memorial is being constructed at the park entrance.
The main feature of the memorial is a 15-foot (4.6 m) black granite obelisk that has the inscription, "May this hallowed ground honor the sacrifice of America's finest veterans, civilians, and their families- past, present, and future. We will never forget." Another major feature of the memorial are five black granite tablets with the seal of the five branches of the American armed forces. At the center of the memorial is a flag plaza with a 30-foot (9.1 m) pole for the American flag and two 25-foot (7.6 m) poles for the Oklahoma flag and the POW/MIA flag. The flag plaza is surrounded by a polished concrete walking area with a stained five-pointed star stretching the entire width and height of the walking area.
A committee was formed to plan the second phase of the Moore Veterans Memorial. A campaign to sell bricks to be placed in the memorial was completed in early 2009. Over 190 bricks were purchased by supporters from the community and surrounding areas. The bricks were placed in the Memorial Wall and Phase II was completed in May 2009.
The Soldiers' Memorial was dedicated on May 15, 2010. It consists of four carved wooden soldiers representing the four major wars since the end of World War I. They include World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and the Afghanistan/Iraq War.
After being destroyed by the May 2013 tornado, the park won the title of "America's Favorite Park" in an online competition sponsored by Coca-Cola, beating out numerous other parks from around the country. First prize was a $100,000 grant, which was combined with other funds to cover the estimated $200,000 in rebuilding expenses. The first steps toward rebuilding began in November 2013, during a groundbreaking ceremony and the awarding of the grant to Mayor Glenn Lewis. The park's playgrounds were estimated to be open to the public in mid-May 2014.
