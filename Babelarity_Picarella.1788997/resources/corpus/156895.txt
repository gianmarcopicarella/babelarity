Elyria (/əˈlɪəriə/; ǝ-LEER-ee-uh) is a city in and the county seat of Lorain County, Ohio, United States, located at the forks of the Black River in Northeast Ohio. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 54,533. The city is named for its founder, Heman Ely. The city is home to Lorain County Community College.
This area was occupied for thousands of years by varying cultures of indigenous peoples. It began to be settled by European Americans after the American Revolutionary War, when demand for land drove settlers west along the Great Lakes from New York and New England.
Elyria was founded along the Black River in 1817 by Heman Ely, who built a log house, dam, gristmill and sawmill on the site. Ely began to build more houses to accommodate European-American settlers migrating to what was then called the Northwest Territory. By the time Ely died in 1852, Elyria had five churches, three grocery stores, three flour mills, a newspaper, and a population of more than 1,500. Early postal service from Cleveland was provided by Artemis Beebe, a rider who held the first contract to deliver mail across the Black River.
By the turn of the 20th century, Elyria was a town of about 8,000. In 1908, Elyria Memorial Hospital was built. It has since evolved into an award-winning regional healthcare system. In the first half of the 20th century, the town developed some manufacturing, as well as a range of retail businesses.
In August 1967, at the peak of Elyria's population, Midway Mall was opened. It changed the local economy by attracting local businesses from the town center or causing so much competition they went out of business. Industrial restructuring meant that good jobs left the area, and poverty increased. Three major car plant closings in the area lead to economic stagnation and joblessness in the 1970s and 1980s that affected numerous communities. The region was nicknamed "the Rustbelt," suggesting the decline of its former industries.
In the 1990s, Elyria experienced a minor revival with construction of some new roads and housing. It serves as a residential, suburban "bedroom community" for Cleveland, located to the east, where new businesses and industries are developing with an increase in new jobs.
