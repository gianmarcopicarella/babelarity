In music, the introduction is a passage or section which opens a movement or a separate piece, preceding the theme or lyrics. In popular music this is often abbreviated as intro. The introduction establishes melodic, harmonic or rhythmic material related to the main body of a piece.
Introductions may consist of an ostinato that is used in the following music, an important chord or progression that establishes the tonality and groove for the following music, or they may be important but disguised or out-of-context motivic or thematic material. As such the introduction may be the first statement of primary or other important material, may be related to but different from the primary or other important material, or may bear little relation to any other material.
